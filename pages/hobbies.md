#### 3D Printing
In my spare time I like to print functional 3D prints. I'm currently printing a lot of Gridfinity, but also exploring Multiboard and other organizational prints. I'm using a Prusa Core One and have been loving the open source community around it.

#### Goodyear Welted Boots
I also like to collect high-quality, goodyear welted, american made boots. My favorite pair of boots are a pair of Nicks Handmade Boots, 8 inches, using Wicket and Craig Natural Double Stuffed Leather, made on the HNW last.

#### High Quality American Made Apparel
I'm venturing into other high quality apparel like my first American Giant Hoodie.
