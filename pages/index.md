Born and raised in Augusta, Georgia, the only subjects that satisfied my curiosity about the world were Math and Science so I studied to be a Computer Engineer at The Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, Georgia. After graduation, I started a career in Tech as a full-stack NodeJS developer in the Northern Virginia area. After two years on a development team, I noticed that most teams lack the necessary infrastructure, build and deploy, and architectural expertise to move faster, and build fault-tolerant, highly available applications, and found my home among Site Reliability Engineering professionals at Cvent in Tysons, VA. 

I'd like to make an impact on your business by leading SRE teams to reduce toil, increse developer productivity, and drive reliability changes measured by SLIs/SLOs.

Outside of my professional life, I'm married to my wife, Monica, and I'm cat dad to our two cats, Marley and Callie.
