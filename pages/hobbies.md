## Hobbies

In my spare time I like to print functional 3D prints. I'm currently printing a lot of Gridfinity, but also exploring Multiboard and other organizational prints. I'm using a Prusa Core One and have been loving the opensource community around it.

I also like to collect high-quality, goodyear welted, american made boots. My favorite pair of boots are an Nicks 8in pair, using Wicket and Craig Natural Double Stuffed Leather, made on the HNW last. 

I'm venturing into other high quality apparel like my first American Giant Hoodie.
