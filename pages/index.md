Born and raised in Augusta, Georgia, the only subjects that satisfied my curiosity about the world were Math and Science so I studied to be a Electrical and Computer Engineer at The Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, Georgia. After graduation, I started a career in the technology industry as a full-stack NodeJS developer. After two years on a development team, I realized that many technology teams lack the necessary infrastructure, build and deploy, and architectural expertise to move faster, and build fault-tolerant, highly available applications, and found my home among Site Reliability Engineering professionals at Cvent. Outside of my professional life, I'm married to my wife, Monica, and pet parent to our two cats, Marley and Callie.
